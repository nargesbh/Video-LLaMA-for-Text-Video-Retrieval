# Cross-Modal Text-Video Retrieval with Video-LLaMA

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository dedicated to my summer internship project with the Language Technology research group. This project is focused on advancing the field of text-video retrieval by applying state-of-the-art multi-modal Large Language Models to the MSR VTT dataset. The core of our research lies in the utilization of Video-LLaMA, an intricate framework that integrates a Vision-Language Branch and an Audio-Language Branch. This integration empowers LLMs with the ability to comprehend both visual and auditory elements within video content.

It's crucial to note that for this internship project, we leveraged the existing Video-LLaMA framework, which was forked from the original repository. Our contribution involved incorporating this framework into our research to enhance text-video retrieval capabilities.

## Project Phases

The internship unfolded in two distinct phases:

1. **Specialized Evaluation Script and X-clip Analysis:**
   - Developed a specialized evaluation script for assessing text-video retrieval systems.
   - Analyzed the performance of the X-clip as a video retrieval system.

2. **Video-LLaMA Integration and Multi-Modal Representation Learning:**
   - Explored the Video-LLaMA framework to harness its potential in video retrieval.
   - Leveraged different components of Video-LLaMA to calculate embeddings of videos and texts, forming the foundation for a robust video-retrieval system.
   - Delved into contrastive multi-modal representation learning, experimenting with networks to align text and video embeddings in the same vector space for efficient information retrieval.
   - Explored various network architectures, including transformers, and tuned parameters to optimize the alignment process.


## Conclusion

This repository serves as a thorough exploration of our efforts aimed at advancing cross-modal text-video information retrieval. It highlights our in-depth exploration of Video-LLaMA's components and their integration into a practical application, emphasizing the potential for advancements in the field of multi-modal language understanding and text-video retrieval.
